\maketitle

This document summarizes the contributions of each team member up to the POC
Demo.  The time period of interest is the time between the beginning of the term
and the POC demo.

\section{Demo Plans}

\wss{What will you be demonstrating}

\section{Team Meeting Attendance}

\wss{For each team member how many team meetings have they attended over the
time period of interest.  This number should be determined from the meeting
issues in the team's repo.  The first entry in the table should be the total
number of team meetings held by the team.}

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{ll}
\toprule
\textbf{Student} & \textbf{Meetings}\\
\midrule
Total & Num\\
Nicholas Fabugais-Inaba & 4 \\
Alex Verity & 4 \\
Jung Woo Lee & 5 \\
Casra Ghazanfari & 5 \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\wss{If needed, an explanation for the counts can be provided here.}

The total for the number of meetings attended could be seen as
being understated for all members. This is because the team has 
had many minor impromptu meetings both online in person which 
did not have specific agendas or were simply to complete more work
without discussion. These minor meetings were not deemed significant
enough for team meeting issues to be created for them.

\section{Supervisor/Stakeholder Meeting Attendance}

\wss{For each team member how many supervisor/stakeholder team meetings have
they attended over the time period of interest.  This number should be determined
from the supervisor meeting issues in the team's repo.  The first entry in the
table should be the total number of supervisor and team meetings held by the
team.  If there is no supervisor, there will usually be meetings with
stakeholders (potential users) that can serve a similar purpose.}

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{ll}
\toprule
\textbf{Student} & \textbf{Meetings}\\
\midrule
Total & Num\\
Name 1 & Num\\
Name 2 & Num\\
Name 3 & Num\\
Name 4 & Num\\
Name 5 & Num\\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\wss{If needed, an explanation for the counts can be provided here.}

\section{Lecture Attendance}

\wss{For each team member how many lectures have they attended over the time
period of interest.  This number should be determined from the lecture issues in
the team's repo.  The first entry in the table should be the total number of
lectures since the beginning of the term.}

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{ll}
\toprule
\textbf{Student} & \textbf{Lectures}\\
\midrule
Total & Num\\
Name 1 & Num\\
Name 2 & Num\\
Name 3 & Num\\
Name 4 & Num\\
Name 5 & Num\\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\wss{If needed, an explanation for the lecture attendance can be provided here.}

\section{TA Document Discussion Attendance}

\wss{For each team member how many of the informal document discussion meetings
with the TA were attended over the time period of interest.}

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{ll}
\toprule
\textbf{Student} & \textbf{Meetings}\\
\midrule
Total & 3\\
Nicholas Fabugais-Inaba & 3 \\
Alex Verity & 3 \\
Jung Woo Lee & 3 \\
Casra Ghazanfari & 3 \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\wss{If needed, an explanation for the attendance can be provided here.}

\section{Commits}

\wss{For each team member how many commits to the main branch have been made
over the time period of interest.  The total is the total number of commits for
the entire team since the beginning of the term.  The percentage is the
percentage of the total commits made by each team member.}

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{lll}
\toprule
\textbf{Student} & \textbf{Commits} & \textbf{Percent}\\
\midrule
Total & 183 & 100\% \\
Nicholas Fabugais-Inaba & 48 & 26\% \\
Alex Verity & 85 & 46\% \\
Jung Woo Lee & 6 & 4\% \\
Casra Ghazanfari & 44 & 24\% \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\wss{If needed, an explanation for the counts can be provided here.  For
instance, if a team member has more commits to unmerged branches, these numbers
can be provided here.  If multiple people contribute to a commit, git allows for
multi-author commits.}

Jung's commits were lost due to account swapping issues in Git. Alex's commits are
higher as we have worked off his computer together as a team.

\section{Issue Tracker}

\wss{For each team member how many issues have they authored (including open and
closed issues (O+C)) and how many have they been assigned (only counting closed
issues (C only)) over the time period of interest.}

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{lll}
\toprule
\textbf{Student} & \textbf{Authored (O+C)} & \textbf{Assigned (C only)}\\
\midrule
Nicholas Fabugais-Inaba & 39 & 14 \\
Alex Verity & 0 & 15 \\
Jung Woo Lee & 10 & 13 \\
Casra Ghazanfari & 22 & 14 \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\wss{If needed, an explanation for the counts can be provided here.}

Nicholas has created all the issues for the deliverable documents and Casra has created
most TA Feedback issues.
