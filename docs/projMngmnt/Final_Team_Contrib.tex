This document summarizes the contributions of each team member for the final
demonstration and documentation.  The time period of interest is the time
between Rev 0 and the Final documentation.

\section{Team Meeting Attendance}

\wss{For each team member how many team meetings have they attended over the
time period of interest.  This number should be determined from the meeting
issues in the team's repo.  The first entry in the table should be the total
number of team meetings held by the team.}

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{ll}
\toprule
\textbf{Student} & \textbf{Meetings}\\
\midrule
Total & 2\\
Nicholas Fabugais-Inaba & 2\\
Casra Ghazanfari & 2\\
Alex Verity & 2\\
Jung Woo Lee & 2\\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

There were much more than 2 team meetings conducted during this time period, many of 
which were very informal and were not recorded using an issue in the repo. This was 
a due to a combination of time crunch and the informal nature of these team meetings.
However, these team meetings were almost always attended by everyone on the team in
some capacity. For example, maybe someone couldn't stay the entire duration of the 
meeting but was still able to contribute their piece and get the gist of the important
information from the other team members.

\wss{If needed, an explanation for the counts can be provided here.}

\section{Supervisor/Stakeholder Meeting Attendance}

\wss{For each team member how many supervisor/stakeholder team meetings have
they attended over the time period of interest.  This number should be determined
from the supervisor meeting issues in the team's repo.  The first entry in the
table should be the total number of supervisor and team meetings held by the
team.  If there is no supervisor, there will usually be meetings with
stakeholders (potential users) that can serve a similar purpose.}

\begin{table}[H]

\begin{tabular}{ll}
\toprule
\textbf{Student} & \textbf{Meetings}\\
\midrule
Total & 3\\
Nicholas Fabugais-Inaba & 2\\
Casra Ghazanfari & 2\\
Alex Verity & 3\\
Jung Woo Lee & 3\\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\wss{If needed, an explanation for the counts can be provided here.}

\section{Lecture Attendance}

\wss{For each team member how many lectures have they attended over the time
period of interest.  This number should be determined from the lecture issues in
the team's repo.  The first entry in the table should be the total number of
lectures since the beginning of the term.}

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{ll}
\toprule
\textbf{Student} & \textbf{Lectures}\\
\midrule
Total & 1\\
Nicholas Fabugais-Inaba & 0\\
Casra Ghazanfari & 0\\
Alex Verity & 0\\
Jung Woo Lee & 1\\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\wss{If needed, an explanation for the lecture attendance can be provided here.}

\section{TA Document Discussion Attendance}

\wss{For each team member how many of the informal document discussion meetings
with the TA were attended over the time period of interest.}

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{ll}
\toprule
\textbf{Student} & \textbf{Lectures}\\
\midrule
Total & 1\\
Nicholas Fabugais-Inaba & 1\\
Casra Ghazanfari & 1\\
Alex Verity & 1\\
Jung Woo Lee & 1\\

\end{table}

\wss{If needed, an explanation for the attendance can be provided here.}

\section{Commits}

\wss{For each team member how many commits to the main branch have been made
over the time period of interest.  The total is the total number of commits for
the entire team since the beginning of the term.  The percentage is the
percentage of the total commits made by each team member.}

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{lll}
\toprule
\textbf{Student} & \textbf{Commits} & \textbf{Percent}\\
\midrule
Total & 1194 & 100\% \\
Nicholas Fabugais-Inaba & 111 & 9.29\% \\
Casra Ghazanfari & 116 & 9.71\% \\
Alex Verity & 157 & 13.14\% \\
Jung Woo Lee & 95 & 7.95\% \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\wss{If needed, an explanation for the counts can be provided here.  For
instance, if a team member has more commits to unmerged branches, these numbers
can be provided here.  If multiple people contribute to a commit, git allows for
multi-author commits.}

\section{Issue Tracker}

\wss{For each team member how many issues have they authored (including open and
closed issues (O+C)) and how many have they been assigned (only counting closed
issues (C only)) over the time period of interest.}

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{lll}
\toprule
\textbf{Student} & \textbf{Authored (O+C)} & \textbf{Assigned (C only)}\\
\midrule
Nicholas Fabugais-Inaba & Num & Num \\
Casra Ghazanfari & Num & Num \\
Alex Verity & Num & Num \\
Jung Woo Lee & Num & Num \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\wss{If needed, an explanation for the counts can be provided here.}
