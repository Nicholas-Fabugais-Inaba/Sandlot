There were much more than two team meetings conducted during this time period, many of 
which were very informal and were not recorded using an issue in the repo. This was 
a due to a combination of time crunch and the informal nature of these team meetings.
However, these team meetings were almost always attended by everyone on the team in
some capacity. For example, maybe someone couldn't stay the entire duration of the 
meeting but was still able to contribute their piece and get the gist of the important
information from the other team members.
