\section{Introduction}

The following document details the Module Interface Specifications for
the implemented modules in a platform designed to organize a seasonal
softball league. It is intended to ease navigation through the platform
for design and maintenance purposes.

Complementary documents include the System Requirement Specifications
and Module Guide.  The full documentation and implementation can be
found at \url{https://github.com/Nicholas-Fabugais-Inaba/Sandlot}.  

\section{Notation}

The structure of the MIS for modules comes from \citet{HoffmanAndStrooper1995},
with the addition that template modules have been adapted from
\cite{GhezziEtAl2003}.  The mathematical notation comes from Chapter 3 of
\citet{HoffmanAndStrooper1995}.  For instance, the symbol := is used for a
multiple assignment statement and conditional rules follow the form $(c_1
\Rightarrow r_1 | c_2 \Rightarrow r_2 | ... | c_n \Rightarrow r_n )$.

The following table summarizes the primitive data types used by \progname. 

\begin{center}
\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.2}
\noindent 
\begin{tabular}{l l p{7.5cm}} 
\toprule 
\textbf{Data Type} & \textbf{Notation} & \textbf{Description}\\ 
\midrule
character & char & a single symbol or digit\\
integer & $\mathbb{Z}$ & a number without a fractional component in (-$\infty$, $\infty$) \\
natural number & $\mathbb{N}$ & a number without a fractional component in [1, $\infty$) \\
real & $\mathbb{R}$ & any number in (-$\infty$, $\infty$)\\
schedule & $S$ & a list of games to be played in a season, see Schedule
Record Module \ref{mSS}\\
% standings & $ST$ & a team's record in a season including wins, losses,
% ties, forfeits, and point differential, see Standings
% Record Module \ref{mST}\\
game & $G$ & a time, date, location, score, team1, and team2 that defines a game to
be played\\
player & $P$ & a player on a team, uses the Account Records Module
\ref{mAS}\\
team & $T$ & a team in the league including a team's id, team's name, team's division,
list of players on the team, and the team's standing in the league,
see Team Records Module \ref{mTS}\\
% date & $d$ & a date in the format YYYY-MM-DD\\
start date & $d_s$ & a date that represents the start of the season\\
end date & $d_e$ & a date that represents the end of the season\\
% time & t & $a$ time in the format HH:MM (24 hour clock)\\
location & $l$ & an integer representing a field\\
division & $D$ & an integer indexing a list of teams that play each other in a
season\\
alert & $A$ & a message to be sent to a list of players, see Alerts Module
\ref{mAL}\\

\bottomrule
\end{tabular} 
\end{center}

\noindent
The specification of \progname \ uses some derived data types: sequences, strings, and
tuples. Sequences are lists filled with elements of the same data type. Strings
are sequences of characters. Tuples contain a list of values, potentially of
different types. In addition, \progname \ uses functions, which
are defined by the data types of their inputs and outputs. Local functions are
described by giving their type signature followed by their specification.

\subsubsection{Assumptions}

For every team in the league, each team plays at least twice the amount of games
as the number of teams in a division.

% Every division has the same amount of teams? Not necessarily if number of
% teams is odd.

% Every team plays the same amount of games? Not necessarily because of above.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item What went well while writing this deliverable? 
  \item What pain points did you experience during this deliverable, and how
    did you resolve them?
  \item Which of your design decisions stemmed from speaking to your client(s)
  or a proxy (e.g. your peers, stakeholders, potential users)? For those that
  were not, why, and where did they come from?
  \item While creating the design doc, what parts of your other documents (e.g.
  requirements, hazard analysis, etc), it any, needed to be changed, and why?
  \item What are the limitations of your solution?  Put another way, given
  unlimited resources, what could you do to make the project better? (LO\_ProbSolutions)

  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Which of your design decisions stemmed from speaking to your client(s)
    or a proxy (e.g. your peers, stakeholders, potential users)? For those that
    were not, why, and where did they come from?\\

    Some of the design decisions pertained to the season scheduler module, which had come directly from
    the supervisor as they had clearly defined both hard constraints, that must be satisfied, and
    soft constraints, that should be optimized for. Additionally, it was important to have a
    module that would specifically deal with the scheduling algorithm for the system's extensibility and
    maintainability purposes. This is because more constraints may be required by the system
    or clients to be added or removed depending on various circumstances, for example, the league's
    requirements may change overtime. Furthermore, our team had decided to create record modules,
    that were not asked for by the client or a proxy as we believed it would help to simplify the
    complexity of the system and improve the system's maintainability, defining important parts
    such as an account or a team.\\
    
    \item While creating the design doc, what parts of your other documents (e.g.
    requirements, hazard analysis, etc), if any, needed to be changed, and why?\\
    
    While creating the design doc, no other documents had to be changed to accomodate any
    design decisions made in the MIS. The requirements identified in the SRS were sufficient
    enough to guide our team in confidently following through with the design decisions that
    were made in the MIS.\\
    
    \item What are the limitations of your solution? Put another way, given
    unlimited resources, what could you do to make the project better? (LO\_ProbSolutions)\\
    
    The limitations of our solution are tightly tied to the hardware/software 
    the system is hosted on. For example, with infinite computing power the 
    website would be able to support upwards of a million concurrent users, 
    and have near 100\% availability (ie. minimal downtime). However, we do not
    have the computing power, or money to buy the computing power necessary to
    provide these benefits. Importantly its not critical that we provide these
    benefits for our project because they're only important for large scale
    projects. Our project is much smaller in scale, and as such we'll be able 
    to provide the necessary concurrent user count and availability for a 
    project of our size without the need for unlimited resources.
    
    \item Give a brief overview of other design solutions you considered. What
    are the benefits and tradeoffs of those other designs compared with the chosen
    design?  From all the potential options, why did you select the documented design?
    (LO\_Explores)\\

    Other design solutions that were considered were to have a separate account verification module
    that would deal with the registration of accounts, which would include the signing of waivers,
    2-factor authentication, and logging into an account. The benefits of this design would be the
    fact that it would help to separate the concerns of the account module to solely deal with the
    editing of an account's details, and the creation or deletion of an account, and the account
    verification module would have dealt with what had been mentioned above. The tradeoffs would
    be that it would have added more complexity to the system, and would have required more time
    to implement and test each module. The reason why our team had selected the documented design
    was because we wanted to make sure that each account would have the same functionality, but
    the type of account (players, teams, and commissioners) would have different functionalities
    associated with the module. The record modules were then selected to account for the
    core parts of the system including the schedule, accounts, and teams.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item What went well while writing this deliverable?\\\\
  When writing this deliverable, the things that went well were the collective brainstorming
  of the modules in the MG that would then be expanded upon in the MIS. Being able to not only
  visualize how the modules would operate together, but a general idea of how the system would
  work as a whole, helped a lot in our identification of the different features our system would
  need to highlight. Another thing that went well was our distribution of tasks as once we had
  identified all of the modules in the MG, we were able to each tackle a different module in the
  MIS.
  \item What pain points did you experience during this deliverable, and how
  did you resolve them?\\\\
  Some of the pain points from this deliverable were figuring out what subsections would apply to
  each module as each module whether it was our record modules or other modules, had varying
  purposes. This issue was resolved by referring back to what we had written in our MG for each
  module's secrets and services as that would help identify any functions that the module would
  have to accomplish for its dedicated tasks. The same resolution was applied to the record
  modules as although they did not necessarily have functions as a part of their module, they still
  had state variables that would define the data structure it pertained to.

\subsection*{Jung Woo Lee -- Reflection}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item What went well while writing this deliverable?\\\\
  Coming up with the specification math for the scheduling module went very smoothly and working on it 
  helped to solidify some of our ideas on the contraints that were only in our head or in plain 
  writing. Futhermore, writing the MIS and thinking at a lower-level helped us refine our thinking on
  how the solution would behave or what data was required where. Lastly, Both documents were worked 
  on diligently and efficiently by the team and we were able to complete them to great effect in a 
  shorter amount of time than the previous documents.  
  \item What pain points did you experience during this deliverable, and how
  did you resolve them?\\\\
  Definitely a large issue I had was defining the modules and separating out their functions as some
  could initially be seen to have overlapping responsibilities. Discussion and more brainstorming with
  the team allowed us to better define the modules and come to our current solution. Another was thinking 
  about the constraints for the specification math where some open questions were discovered and are 
  left unanswered until our next meeting with our supervisor where it will be cleared up.

\subsection*{Casra Ghazanfari -- Reflection}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item What went well while writing this deliverable?\\\\
  Writing the mathematical specification for our scheduling algorithm went well
  because we already had a portion of its code implemented which allowed us to
  much more easily translate that existing code into a mathematical 
  specification than if we were to create the specification before starting
  any implementation of the module. Additionally, because the scheduling 
  algorithm is the most mathematically complex module in our system, 
  having an existing implementation greatly reduced the overall workload of 
  this deliverable making the overall process of writing this deliverable much
  easier.
    
  \item What pain points did you experience during this deliverable, and how
  did you resolve them?\\\\
  The biggest pain point during this deliverable was our team's inexperience
  using LaTeX for formal mathematical specifications. Due to our inexperience 
  the most difficult part of this deliverable wasn't creating the mathematical
  specifications, but instead properly formatting them. We resolved this issue 
  by spending extra time learning how mathematical specification is done with 
  LaTeX using online resources. After taking the time to learn, writing the 
  deliverable became much easier and quicker.

\subsection*{Alexander Verity -- Reflection}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item What went well while writing this deliverable?\\\\
  The writing of the MIS went well as we were able to quickly identify the
  modules that we needed to implement and the functions that they would need.
  The modules were not always easy to identify, but they helped us to break
  figure out the structure of our solution and will help when developing the
  final product.

  \item What pain points did you experience during this deliverable, and how
  did you resolve them?\\\\
  The biggest pain point was writing the specification math for the scheduling
  module. It was difficult to figure out how to express the constraints in a
  percise way that fully defines the module. We resolved this by working
  together to brainstorm the constraints and researching a little more into
  how specification math works.
