\section{Introduction}

Sandlot is intended to be the successor for the current McMaster GSA
softball league scheduling and management platform. This project
will implement the current functionality from the existing system including
additional features such as a new login system, commissioner admin
privileges, and an improvement to the robustness, ease of use, and
maintainability to the platform.

Hazards are conditions of the product system that could lead to undesirable outcomes. 
In Sandlot, hazards of security, malfunctions, usability, among others will be analyzed.

\section{Scope and Purpose of Hazard Analysis}

Hazard analysis aims to identify potential hazards that may exist with the product, 
understand their causes and effects, and provide proactive strategies to mitigate
them.
The purpose of this document is to perform this analysis for Sandlot, investigate potential
hazards and give means of mitigating the issues identified. 
Hazards to Sandlot could take the form of user interface misinterpretations, misinputted data,
and database errors, leading to possible malfunctions with the product and/or user 
dissatisfaction.
This document will first identify the system components and boundaries, state the critical
assumptions, use a Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) table to identify the hazards
and their causes, effects, and mitigation strategies, and lastly the requirements that
are discovered from the analysis.

\section{System Boundaries and Components}

\subsection{System Components}
The system can be divided into the following components:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Authentication
    \subitem This component authenticates user inputted login information with the database
    and determines whether a login is successful.
    \item Scheduling
    \subitem This component generates a schedule based on user inputted availability data. 
    Additionally, it allows for rescheduling events in these schedules after they 
    have been generated.
    \item Accounts
    \subitem This component allows users to create, delete or edit accounts. Additionally, account types 
    determine the ways in which a user can interact with the system, its data, and its components.
    \item Team Structure
    \subitem This component is a data structure of the system which allows accounts to be grouped together 
    such that a group of accounts interact with the system, its data, and its components in the same way as 
    each other. Additionally, accounts can be added/removed from teams, users can request to join a 
    certain team, and teams can be created/deleted.
    \item Scoring/Standings
    \subitem This component allows users to input score data associated with specific events and will 
    generate cumulative standings based on score data.
    \item Alerts
    \subitem This component alerts users of important information related to the system.
    \item Database
    \subitem This component stores the system's data.
    \item User Interface
    \subitem This component displays the system's data to the user.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{System Boundaries}
The alerts system component is responsible for allowing users with commissioner
permissions to send alerts to any parties interacting with the user interface.

\section{Critical Assumptions}

\wss{These assumptions that are made about the software or system.  You should
minimize the number of assumptions that remove potential hazards.  For instance,
you could assume a part will never fail, but it is generally better to include
this potential failure mode.}

\begin{itemize}
    \item It is assumed users will only login to their respective accounts that they
    have created within the system and not attempt to login to any other user accounts
    to take advantage of certain permissions the system may allow.
\end{itemize}

\section{Failure Mode and Effect Analysis}

\wss{Include your FMEA table here. This is the most important part of this document.}
\wss{The safety requirements in the table do not have to have the prefix SR.
The most important thing is to show traceability to your SRS. You might trace to
requirements you have already written, or you might need to add new
requirements.}
\wss{If no safety requirement can be devised, other mitigation strategies can be
entered in the table, including strategies involving providing additional
documentation, and/or test cases.}\\

\section{Roadmap}

\wss{Which safety requirements will be implemented as part of the capstone timeline?
Which requirements will be implemented in the future?}

The hazard analysis resulted in new safety and security requirements being
introduced to the project's already existing requirements located in the
SRS. Provided the time constraints and current project deadlines, critical
requirements will be initially addressed with lower priority requirements
being investigated in the future. The hazard analysis will be used as a guideline
to ensure the safety and security of the Sandlot platform's users.

\subsection*{Nicholas Fabugais-Inaba -- Reflection}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item What went well while writing this deliverable?\\\\
  When writing this deliverable, outlining the different failure modes and effects 
  helped in understanding what hazards could impact our project from more than just a
  surface level view. More specifically, content in components such as scheduling and
  alerts, aided in my understanding of how each user may be impacted by a type of failure
  that could occur within the system.
  \item What pain points did you experience during this deliverable, and how
  did you resolve them?\\\\
  Some of the pain points from this deliverable had to deal with brainstorming
  appropriate hazards that may impact a user in the system. With many working components,
  there are a lot of hazards that could occur or that could be easily handled. 
  Understanding which hazards could impact the users the most, which the team would then
  focus on to address primarily before other secondary hazards, was really crucial
  in the completion of this deliverable. These pain points were resolved
  by brainstorming together as a team our own failure modes that we would then review
  amongst each other, if a member needed a second opinion on the component they were
  working on. This would help all of us to understand if the hazard was crucial to
  address for the sake of the system users or if it could be dealt with in an alternative
  way, and therefore not need to be listed.
  \item Which of your listed risks had your team thought of before this
  deliverable, and which did you think of while doing this deliverable? For
  the latter ones (ones you thought of while doing the Hazard Analysis), how
  did they come about?
  \\\\
  Before this deliverable, one of the bigger risks our team had thought of before
  this deliverable was what we would need to do to address scheduling conflicts.
  We knew the scheduling portion of the system was an important aspect of this project
  and would need to be dealt with appropriately to have a robust system rather than the
  current platform that is prone to many errors. Some of the latter risks such as the
  alerts or the accounts risks came about as the team understood alerts could be misread,
  so to make it as easy as possible for users, the platform would need to make sure any
  announcements were to be clear and readable. Additionally, for account risks,
  on a rare occasion where all commissioner level accounts are deleted, we thought of
  making sure to put a safeguard so at the very least there could be one account, since
  users could make the mistake of deleting accounts by accident.
  \item Other than the risk of physical harm (some projects may not have any
  appreciable risks of this form), list at least 2 other types of risk in
  software products. Why are they important to consider?\\\\
  In software products, 2 other risks could be associated with a system shutdown from
  loss of battery life or some type of malware that could impact the software in
  a negative way. These would be important to consider as in the case for a failure
  from the system, there should be a failsafe to deal with such a mode as system integrity
  could be impacted as well as the user's device itself. In terms of malware, it could
  also impact the system's integrity leaving it vulnerable to impact users with faulty
  links that could damage a user's device. Malware could also crash the software system
  itself, which would be detrimental.

\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Casra Ghazanfari -- Reflection}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item What went well while writing this deliverable?\\\\
  Writing the “System Components” section of this deliverable went well for our 
  team. This is because going into this deliverable we already had a concrete 
  idea of the structure of our overall system. This allowed us to quickly 
  partition the system into components based on our ideas for the overall 
  structure. Moreover, due to our existing understanding of the overall system 
  we were able to easily envision and determine how the derived components of 
  the system would interact with each other and the system boundaries.
  \item What pain points did you experience during this deliverable, and how
  did you resolve them?\\\\
  The biggest pain point during this deliverable was connecting hazards in our 
  FMEA table to security requirements (SRs). This is because our SRS deliverable 
  was incomplete at the time of writing this deliverable and did not have a 
  proper set of security requirements to connect to any of the hazards 
  identified in the FMEA. This significantly increased the amount of work 
  needed for us to properly complete this deliverable and generally slowed down 
  the process of creating the FMEA table as well.
  \item Which of your listed risks had your team thought of before this
  deliverable, and which did you think of while doing this deliverable? For
  the latter ones (ones you thought of while doing the Hazard Analysis), how
  did they come about?\\\\
  The team didn’t concretely identify any risks prior to working on this 
  deliverable, but had loose ideas of more obvious potential risks to include 
  in the deliverable. “The user incorrectly inputting their login information” 
  or “the user joining the wrong team” are examples of risks we had thought of 
  before working on this deliverable. Risks like “all commissioner accounts are 
  deleted” and “account is given wrong permissions” are examples of risks we 
  thought of while working through this deliverable. Generally, the idea to 
  include these risks came from carefully evaluating each individual component 
  defined previously in the document and asking ourselves the question: 
  “if anything could go wrong, what would go wrong?”. From this line of thinking 
  we were able to envision and identify uncommon risk scenarios for the system 
  that were tied to the system’s more complex components.
  \item Other than the risk of physical harm (some projects may not have any
  appreciable risks of this form), list at least 2 other types of risk in
  software products. Why are they important to consider?\\\\
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Security risks\\
    Software products that handle sensitive data (i.e. personal / financial / 
    health information) must consider the risks of handling sensitive information. 
    Data can be stolen through unauthorized access and data breaches and can cause 
    financial and reputational harm to both the users and owners of the product. 
    Therefore, security risks such as data breaches are important to consider when 
    handling sensitive data, especially when trying to comply with data protection 
    regulations.
    \item Operational risks\\
    Software products that require high availability must consider the risks of 
    relying on services outside the product’s system boundary. For example, when 
    using a hosting service provided by another organization to host the product’s 
    website or database, There’s the inherent risk that if the organization hosting 
    the service faces issues, so will your product. Issues like these can cause 
    delays or system downtime for your product which is especially harmful if the 
    product requires high availability as downtime negatively impacts the user 
    satisfaction and experience of users of the product.
  \end{enumerate}

\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Alexander Verity -- Reflection}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item What went well while writing this deliverable?\\\\
  The new requirements added needed coverage to the SRS document. Thinking
  about hazards helped a lot in adding requirements, and I am much more
  confident about the requirements document after the hazard analysis. Once
  again the TA meeting was extremely helpful, many good questions answered
  insightfully. The TA meetings help team confidence above all else. The
  supervisor meeting also was very helpful and will lead to many other changes
  to the SRS.

  \item What pain points did you experience during this deliverable, and how
  did you resolve them?\\\\
  What to add as a critical assumption was something the team debated over a
  long time. I feel like we ended up with a good critical assumption section
  but it took a lot of thinking and it is probably the part of the document
  we are least confident. The system boundary section was also difficult and
  required a lot of thinking.

  \item Which of your listed risks had your team thought of before this
  deliverable, and which did you think of while doing this deliverable? For
  the latter ones (ones you thought of while doing the Hazard Analysis), how
  did they come about?\\\\
  We had thought of the coaches inputting incorrect scoring, as that is the
  part of the scoring process that is completely reliant on users to work
  correctly (however our supervisor has told us that the current system as
  never had an issue with scoring). Most of the risks we thought of while
  doing the deliverable. They mostly came about by analyzing the different
  parts of our system in section 3.

  \item Other than the risk of physical harm (some projects may not have any
  appreciable risks of this form), list at least 2 other types of risk in
  software products. Why are they important to consider?\\\\
  In our solution specifically, lack of fairness in a competitive competition.
  The league, although not every team needs to be of a high skill level,
  relies on teams taking it somewhat seriously for the most fun when playing
  games. Fairness is an important element of this. Without fairness players
  would be frustrated and likely not participate in the league. Another type
  of risk is privacy, with users personal information being leaked and used in
  ways the user didn't intend. This is important as privacy is a growing
  concern and something people value. It can also be financially dangerous or
  even physically dangerous, although that specifically is more rare.
