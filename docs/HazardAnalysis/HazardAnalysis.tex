\section{Introduction}

This documentation covers the hazard analysis for the Sandlot project.
Sandlot is intended to be the successor for the current McMaster GSA
softball league scheduling and management platform. This project
will implement the current functionality from the existing system including
additional features such as a new login system, commissioner admin
privileges, and an improvement to the robustness, ease of use, and
maintainability to the platform.

\section{Scope and Purpose of Hazard Analysis}

\wss{You should say what \textbf{loss} could be incurred because of the
hazards.}

\section{System Boundaries and Components}

\wss{Dividing the system into components will help you brainstorm the hazards.
You shouldn't do a full design of the components, just get a feel for the major
ones.  For projects that involve hardware, the components will typically include
each individual piece of hardware.  If your software will have a database, or an
important library, these are also potential components.}

\wss{If you look at the samples, the components are where the hazards may come from.
I think you could probably think of it as what section of the product the hazard will come from.
Try using them to figure how how to break Sandlot down into components.}

System Components:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Database
    \item Login System (Authentication?)
    \item Scheduler
    \item Commissioner accounts and actions (idk if these are considered components)
    \item Captain accounts and actions
    \item Player accounts and actions
    \item Non-accounts and actions
    \item Front-end interface
    \item Middleware (idk)
    \item 
\end{itemize}

\section{Critical Assumptions}

\wss{These assumptions that are made about the software or system.  You should
minimize the number of assumptions that remove potential hazards.  For instance,
you could assume a part will never fail, but it is generally better to include
this potential failure mode.}

\section{Failure Mode and Effect Analysis}

\wss{Include your FMEA table here. This is the most important part of this document.}
\wss{The safety requirements in the table do not have to have the prefix SR.
The most important thing is to show traceability to your SRS. You might trace to
requirements you have already written, or you might need to add new
requirements.}
\wss{If no safety requirement can be devised, other mitigation strategies can be
entered in the table, including strategies involving providing additional
documentation, and/or test cases.}\\

\section{Safety and Security Requirements}

\wss{Newly discovered requirements.  These should also be added to the SRS.  (A
rationale design process how and why to fake it.)}

\section{Roadmap}

\wss{Which safety requirements will be implemented as part of the capstone timeline?
Which requirements will be implemented in the future?}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item What went well while writing this deliverable? 
    \item What pain points did you experience during this deliverable, and how
    did you resolve them?
    \item Which of your listed risks had your team thought of before this
    deliverable, and which did you think of while doing this deliverable? For
    the latter ones (ones you thought of while doing the Hazard Analysis), how
    did they come about?
    \item Other than the risk of physical harm (some projects may not have any
    appreciable risks of this form), list at least 2 other types of risk in
    software products. Why are they important to consider?
\end{enumerate}
