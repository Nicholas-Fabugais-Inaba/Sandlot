\section{Purpose of the Project}

\subsection{User Business}

The McMaster GSA softball league's current scheduling and management platform
is used from the 1st week of May until the last week of August. The website
creates a season schedule based on the 30-40 teams that are entered into the
league by their respective captains. If scheduling conflicts or weather concerns
occur, games can be rescheduled by the team captains based on a team's
availability. For the many users interacting with the platform, individuals need
an intuitive interface that is robust and will allow administrators to easily
maintain the system, especially when the website experiences problems. The current
platform lacks the capabilities to provide these functionalities to the players,
captains, and commissioners. With this project, our team is provided an
opportunity to apply our software engineering background to fulfill a
desired need for an upgrade to an outdated website.

\subsection{Goals of the Project}
Our goals with the project are to recreate everything the current website
solution does, with a better user interface and a more stable foundation, so
that future site admins and league commissioners don't have to deal with the
solution breaking or captains/players not understanding how to use the tool.
We also plan to add features such as player accounts to help players view
their schedules, and a standings viewer to see league scores.

\section{Stakeholders}
\subsection{Client}

The client of the project, Dr. Jake Nease, is an active participant in the
McMaster GSA softball league and understands the difficulties associated with
the current scheduling and management platform. The stability and maintainability
concerns with the website are driving factors that contribute to the need for
an improved interface.

Dr. Nease will meet with the team to discuss the project and provide insight
to requirements desired in the product. Dr. Nease may also help gather
stakeholders to test the product.

\subsection{Customer}

The customers for this project include the players, captains, commissioners,
umpires, and other individuals that may interact with the website. These
individuals require an easy-to-use platform that allows them to seamlessly
enter the website and view the season schedule, regardless of whether they have an
account created. 

\subsection{Other Stakeholders}

Future website administrators and maintainers have an interest in the
maintainability, learnability of administrative functions, and the robustness
of the website.

\subsection{Hands-On Users of the Project}

\begin{itemize}
  \item [All Users]
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Actions: Create an account, log in to their account.
    \item Necessary Information: Their login details.
  \end{itemize}
  \item [Players]
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Actions: Request to join a team, view season schedule.
    \item Necessary Information: Their team's name and details, and the season
    schedule.
  \end{itemize}
  \item [Captains]
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Actions: Create a team account, view schedule and reschedule a game.
    \item Necessary Information: Team account login details, team's game
    details including schedule, and days the team is free to reschedule a
    game.
  \end{itemize}
  \item [Commissioners]
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Actions: Send leage alerts, assign teams to divisions, manually
    update schedule and team information such as player lists.
    \item Necessary Information: Alert content, team division information,
    schedule changes.
  \end{itemize}
  \item [Umpires]
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Actions: View schedule. (This type of user does not need an
    account.)
    \item Necessary Information: Season schedule.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Personas}

\begin{itemize}
  \item [1.]
  
  Josh Brown is a 26-year-old player that has recently joined the McMaster GSA
  softball league, and he is unfamiliar with how the website functions. As someone
  who understands how technology works though, he is able to navigate the interface
  quite well. However, some links he interacts with give him a 404 page not found
  error. This aggravates Josh as he just wants to understand certain information
  about the softball league, but the website isn't able to provide it to him
  because the links on the website are faulty or other issues occur. Josh, along
  with many others who are new to the league, may be technically literate, but due
  to the structural integrity of the system, there are many times when users may
  not be able to access certain information because there is either an error or a
  link that leads to nothing.
  \item [2.]
  
  Ken Phillips is a 58-year-old captain for his McMaster GSA softball team, and he has
  been using the current website for as long as he can remember. Although he is not
  too familiar with how technology works, he is still able to navigate and utilize the
  website's functionalities as he has used them for quite some time now. Unfortunately,
  with the creation of the new website, even though the website has the same existing
  functions as the old system, he is not as familiar with how to navigate the interface
  the same way he has before. Ken and other individuals that may be comfortable and
  familiar with the current outdated platform, need the new website to be easy-to-use,
  especially for people that are either older or not as technically literate.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Priorities Assigned to Users}

\begin{itemize}
  \item [Key Users]
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Players
    \item Captains
    \item Commissioners
  \end{itemize}
  \item [Secondary Users]
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Umpires
  \end{itemize}
  \item [Unimportant Users]
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Spectators
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{User Participation}

Mainly user participation will be for testing the product. This can
be done by many users included below:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Players
  \item Captains
  \item Commissioners
  \item Umpires
  \item Spectators
  \item Project Supervisor
\end{itemize}

Additionally, the project supervisor will provide valuable
insight about the existing system and its capabilities. These
will be used to improve the overall design that will be implemented
in the new system.

\subsection{Maintenance Users and Service Technicians}

The team will be maintaining the product over the development phase until
March 2025. Knowledge transfer will then be handed over to the
project supervisor along with documentation and other information to aid
in the maintaining of the new platform after development is completed.

\section{Relevant Facts And Assumptions}
\subsection{Relevant Facts}
\begin{itemize}
  \item The current solution is a website with URL 
  \url{https://www.gsasoftball.ca/}
  \item There are currently 25-32 teams in the league playing an average of
  100 games a month.
  \item Many users are older and require an intuitive UI to enjoy using the
  site
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Business Rules}
Not applicable.

\subsection{Assumptions}
\begin{itemize}
  \item All users will understand how to log in to a website using a username
  and password.
  \item Users will know how a softball league is structured and how it functions.
\end{itemize}

\section{The Scope of the Work}
\subsection{The Current Situation}
It is important to note that we will not be using the existing solution other
than as a feature guide. The current solution is hosted on the web and is
written in PHP. The current login system does not use a username and password.
Only captains can log in, and they are emailed an ASCII code which they use to
access the website to schedule games and submit scores. Commissioners can log in
in the same way as captains and can modify schedules, scores and team
compositions as needed. Currently, the standings functionality, which would
allow users to view the scores of played games, is not working.

concerning considering the age group and lack of technical literacy
for some users. One precaution that can be taken is to create a user
guide to aid users in interacting with the new system and the various
features it has to offer.

\section*{Appendix --- Reflection}

The information in this section will be used to evaluate the team members on the
graduate attribute of Lifelong Learning.  Please answer the following questions:

\subsection*{Team -- Reflection}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item What knowledge and skills will the team collectively need to acquire to
  successfully complete this capstone project?  Examples of possible knowledge
  to acquire include domain specific knowledge from the domain of your
  application, or software engineering knowledge, mechatronics knowledge or
  computer science knowledge.  Skills may be related to technology, or writing,
  or presentation, or team management, etc.  You should look to identify at
  least one item for each team member.

  The team collectively needs to acquire lots of knowledge skills to successfully 
  complete this capstone project. In particular, Web development skills and knowledge 
  about the React language  will be key in developing a working website efficiently. SQL 
  skills and knowledge about database design and data migrations will be extremely useful 
  when working to store the website’s information properly. Knowledge on hosting these 
  different pieces of the project as well as learning how to properly integrate our project 
  with the host and finally, domain knowledge of the UI/UX design of existing scheduling 
  solutions on the market so that we can learn from existing solutions to ensure our 
  ease-of-use and user experience is top of the line. Casra will take on the web development 
  skills and knowledge, Nicholas will tackle the SQL skills and database knowledge, 
  Alex will look into hosting information and integrations, and Jung Woo will look into 
  domain knowledge of existing scheduling systems.

  \item For each of the knowledge areas and skills identified in the previous
  question, what are at least two approaches to acquiring the knowledge or
  mastering the skill?  Of the identified approaches, which will each team
  member pursue, and why did they make this choice?

  Web development skills and knowledge of the React language can be learned either by reading 
  the React documentation or by starting a separate test project and spending some time 
  learning by experimenting with the language. SQL skills and database design knowledge can 
  be learned by either creating practice queries on a dummy database or taking an online 
  structured learning course. Knowledge about hosting the different components of the project 
  can be gained by getting hands-on experience with cloud hosting platforms such as Microsoft 
  Azure or AWS or by testing hosting in a local environment on our own computers. To gain 
  domain knowledge of UI/UX design of scheduling platforms can either be gained by 
  investigating existing systems hands on and analyzing their UI/UX or by surveying people 
  about different applications they use and what parts of them they like/dislike.
  Casra will pursue learning web development and React by creating a separate test project 
  because he finds that learning by doing is much more effective for him than other methods. 
  Nicholas will pursue learning SQL and database design by taking an structured online course 
  on the subject because he feels that the more structured nature of the course will help him 
  learn consistently. Alex will pursue getting hands-on experience with cloud hosting 
  platforms because these platforms are likely what we will be using for the project and 
  so getting experience with them would be beneficial. Finally, Jung Woo will pursue 
  investigating the UI/UX domain knowledge and design of existing scheduling systems hands 
  on because he feels as though he will learn more from the existing system will give 
  insights into the developer's perspective of UI/UX design which will be helpful for us as 
  the developers.

\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Alex Verity -- Reflection}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item What went well while writing this deliverable?\\\\
  The parts that went well for me were the non-functional requirements, I felt
  the look and feel section gave me a much better idea of what the solution is
  going to look like. The TA meeting was also extremely helpful and gave me a
  much better perspective on the project and confidence in our solution.
  \item What pain points did you experience during this deliverable, and how
  did you resolve them?\\\\
  Some pain points experienced were trying to get full coverage when coming up
  with use cases and functional requirements, we have many more questions for
  the supervisor now and will almost certainly need to come back to this
  document and modify it with new information we receive. I still don't know
  if the use cases provided are well put together or not and will be looking
  heavily at feedback in that area.
  \item How many of your requirements were inspired by speaking to your
  client(s) or their proxies (e.g. your peers, stakeholders, potential users)?
  \\\\
  Almost all requirements are inspired by speaking to our supervisor and
  primary stakeholder, as he defined the entire project during meetings with
  him. We were also heavily inspired by the TA meeting, where many of the
  look and feel requirements and user guide requirements came from, as well
  as advice on what to make into functional requirements.
  \item Which of the courses you have taken, or are currently taking, will help
  your team to be successful with your capstone project.\\\\
  The class 4HC3, whose subject is human computer interfaces and talks mainly
  about designing user interface. One of the main goals of the project is
  designing the UI to be more readable and better designed than the current
  solution, so any learning in that regard will be vital.

\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Jung Woo Lee -- Reflection}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item What went well while writing this deliverable?\\\\
  Coming up with most of the requirements was easier than expected due to the breadth of information we had from talking with the supervisor on the product.
  
  
  \item What pain points did you experience during this deliverable, and how
  did you resolve them?\\\\
  Going through and working on this document, made me realize how much more we as a team probably need to know about user needs. Sometimes we were left with questions on if something was a requirement or not. All of this indicated to the fact that we need to have more time to speak to our supervisor.
  
  \item How many of your requirements were inspired by speaking to your
  client(s) or their proxies (e.g. your peers, stakeholders, potential users)?\\\\
  Almost all of the requirements came from the supervisor, who is both a potential user and stakeholder. With the initial information he provided us on the problem and desired product, we could develop most of these requirements. A few of the requirements were not explicitly told to us, but could be inferred and others have been created by us to conform with ethical practices for example.
  
  \item Which of the courses you have taken, or are currently taking, will help
  your team to be successful with your capstone project.\\\\
  All project based courses are definitely useful to understand project dynamics. Dealing with a team, and performing to certain standards has been taught to us in all of these various courses. Providing deliverables and project scheduling has also been taught to us, such that administrative duties are easier for us to tackle. The databases course will likely help us as our project will most likely be using this in our solution. The user-interface course will help us in creating a human-centered design that is intuitive and clean. This is one of the pitfalls of the current solution, and thus one of the important non-functional requirements. The requirements course will also help us interpret requirements going forward and make use of our work here. And late it will undoubtedly help us revise this document.

\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Nicholas Fabugais-Inaba -- Reflection}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item What went well while writing this deliverable?\\\\
  When writing this deliverable, outlining the different requirements associated
  with the varying aspects of the project helped in understanding what is required
  from the team to accomplish a completed product for this project. More specifically,
  outlining the access requirements and creating the hierarchy diagram aided in
  my understanding of how each user will interact with the system.
  \item What pain points did you experience during this deliverable, and how
  did you resolve them?\\\\
  Some of the pain points from this deliverable was the amount of content 
  needed to be covered with all of the different sections. With so many different
  types of requirements in mind and the number of overlapping requirements, it
  was incredibly difficult to fill in each section or understand why a certain
  type of requirement may not apply to the project. These pain points were resolved
  by brainstorming as a team our own requirements that we would then review
  amongst each other to understand if the requirement was satisfactory enough
  or if it should be constructed in a different way.
  \item How many of your requirements were inspired by speaking to your
  client(s) or their proxies (e.g. your peers, stakeholders, potential users)?
  \\\\
  From both the TA and the initial meeting with the project supervisor, the team
  was able to get a grasp on the requirements that must be important to mention
  in the SRS. Mainly the project supervisor was able to outline the overall
  requirements needed to improve on the existing system, however, the TA was 
  still able to provide valuable insight into either how general or how specific
  a requirement should be defined.
  \item Which of the courses you have taken, or are currently taking, will help
  your team to be successful with your capstone project.\\\\
  Specifically for the SRS, our software requirements class that is primarily taken
  in the 3rd year for software engineering students aided in the creation
  of the SRS document. Additionally, our software design III course will help the
  team be successful with the capstone project as we had created a prototype design
  similar to Uber. Collaborating with a team for a project that had many moving
  parts to it should surely aid in the creation of the team's initial MVP for
  the project as well as the development towards the final product that will
  be showcased early in 2025.

\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Casra Ghazanfari -- Reflection}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item What went well while writing this deliverable?\\\\
  Writing the functional requirements section of this deliverable went well 
  because we had access to the old existing system that the project is aiming 
  to improve upon. This allowed us to look at the old existing system’s functionalities 
  and easily come up with functional requirements that the new system would need to meet 
  based on the old system’s functionalities.
  \item What pain points did you experience during this deliverable, and how
  did you resolve them?\\\\
  The biggest pain point during this deliverable was understanding what each section 
  of the document was asking for. Many sections of the document have unintuitive names 
  that do not accurately describe the information the section should hold. In addition, many 
  of the sections were either inapplicable or very loosely applicable to our project making 
  it difficult to understand which sections we should be tackling.
  \item How many of your requirements were inspired by speaking to your
  client(s) or their proxies (e.g. your peers, stakeholders, potential users)?
  \\\\
  There isn’t an exact number but ~25\% of our requirements are directly inspired/created 
  from information we got while talking to our client. Most prominently our look and feel 
  requirements were directly from our discussions where we learned that UX and ease of use 
  were extremely important factors for both the client and users of our system.
  \item Which of the courses you have taken, or are currently taking, will help
  your team to be successful with your capstone project.\\\\
  SFWRENG 3XB3 Software Engineering Practice and Experience is a project oriented software 
  design course which is, and will be extremely helpful for a successful capstone project. 
  3XB3 taught effective software design and got me used to the workflow of a software project 
  which will both be very applicable to our capstone.
