\section{Purpose of the Project}

\subsection{User Business}

The McMaster GSA softball league's current scheduling and management platform
is used from the 1st week of May until the last week of August. The website
creates a season schedule based on the 30-40 teams that are entered into the
league by their respective captains. If scheduling conflicts or weather concerns
occur, games are able to be rescheduled by the team captains based on a team's
availability. For the many users interacting with the platform, individuals need
an intuitive interface that is robust and will allow administrators to easily
maintain the system, especially when the website experiences problems. The current
platform lacks the capabilities to provide these functionalities to the players,
captains, and commissioners. With this project, our team is provided an
opportunity to apply our software engineering background to fulfill a
desired need for an upgrade to an outdated website.

\subsection{Goals of the Project}
Our goals with the project are to recreate everything the current website
solution does, with a better user interface and a more stable foundation, so
that future site admins and league commissioners don't have to deal with the
solution breaking or captains/players not understanding how to use the tool.
We also plan to add features such as player accounts to help players view
their schedules, and a standings viewer to see league scores.

\section{Stakeholders}
\subsection{Client}

The client of the project, Dr. Jake Nease, is an active participant in the
McMaster GSA softball league and understands the difficulties associated with
the current scheduling and management platform. The stability and maintainability
concerns with the website are driving factors that contribute to the need for
an improved interface.

\subsection{Customer}

The customers for this project include the players, captains, commissioners,
umpires, and other individuals that may interact with the website. These
individuals require an easy-to-use platform that allows them to seamlessly
enter the website and view the season schedule, whether or not they have an
account created. 

\subsection{Other Stakeholders}

Future website administrators and maintainers have an interest in the
maintainability, learnability of administrative functions, and the robustness
of the website.

\subsection{Hands-On Users of the Project}

\begin{itemize}
  \item [Players]
  \begin{itemize}
    \item User creates an account, logins to their account,
    and requests to join a team.
    \item User needs to know their login details, the team they
    will join, game details from looking at the schedule.
  \end{itemize}
  \item [Captains]
  \begin{itemize}
    \item User creates an account, logins to their account,
    creates a team, and reschedules a game.
    \item User needs to know their login details, game details from
    looking at the schedule, days the team is free to reschedule a game.
  \end{itemize}
  \item [Commissioners]
  \begin{itemize}
    \item User creates an account, logins to their account,
    can send leage alerts, and assign teams to divisions.
    \item User needs to know their login details, and what alerts
    they may need to send to the league.
  \end{itemize}
  \item [Umpires]
  \begin{itemize}
    \item User needs to view the schedule for the game they will
    be the umpire for.
    \item User needs to know the game details from looking at the
    schedule.
  \end{itemize}
  \item [Project Supervisor]
  \begin{itemize}
    \item User will help gather stakeholders to test the product,
    meet with the team to discuss the project, provide insight
    to requirements desired in the product.
    \item User needs to know how to contact the team, which stakeholders
    can be contacted to test the product, what requirements are needed
    to satisfy the needs of the project.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Personas}

\begin{itemize}
  \item [1.]
  
  Josh Brown is a 26 year old player that has recently joined the McMaster GSA
  softball league and he is unfamiliar with how the website functions. As someone
  who understands how technology works though, he is able to navigate the interface
  quite well. However, some links he interacts with give him a 404 page not found
  error. This aggravates Josh as he just wants to understand certain information
  about the softball league, but the website isn't able to provide it to him
  because the links on the website are faulty or other issues occur. Josh, along
  with many others who are new to the league, may be technically literate, but due
  to the structural integrity of the system, there are many times where users may
  not be able to access certain information because there is either an error or a
  link that leads to nothing.
  \item [2.]
  
  Ken Phillips is a 58 year old captain for his McMaster GSA softball team and he has
  been using the current website for as long as he can remember. Although he is not
  too familiar with how technology works, he is still able to navigate and utilize the
  website's functionalities as he has used them for quite some time now. Unfortunately,
  with the creation of the new website, even though the website has the same existing
  functions as the old system, he is not as familiar with how to navigate the interface
  the same way he has before. Ken and other individuals that may be comfortable and
  familiar with the current outdated platform, need the new website to be easy-to-use,
  especially for people that are either older or not as technically literate.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Priorities Assigned to Users}

\begin{itemize}
  \item [Key Users]
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Players
    \item Captains
    \item Commissioners
  \end{itemize}
  \item [Secondary Users]
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Umpires
  \end{itemize}
  \item [Unimportant Users]
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Spectators
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{User Participation}

Mainly user participation will be for testing the product. This can
be done by many users included below:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Players
  \item Captains
  \item Commissioners
  \item Umpires
  \item Spectators
  \item Project Supervisor
\end{itemize}

Additionally, the project supervisor will provide valuable
insight about the existing system and its capabilities. These
will be used to improve the overall design that will be implemented
in the new system.

\subsection{Maintenance Users and Service Technicians}

The team will be maintaining the product over the development phase until
March 2025. Knowledge transfer will then be handed over to the
project supervisor along with documentation and other information to aid
in the maintaining of the new platform after development is completed.

\section{Relevant Facts And Assumptions}
\subsection{Relevant Facts}
\begin{itemize}
  \item The current solution is a website with url 
  \url{https://www.gsasoftball.ca/}
  \item There are currently 25-32 teams in the league playing an average of
  100 games a month.
  \item Many users are older and require an intuitive UI to enjoy using the
  site
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Business Rules}
Not applicable

\subsection{Assumptions}
\begin{itemize}
  \item All users will understand how to log in to a website using a username
  and password.
  \item Users will know how a softball league is structured and how it functions.
\end{itemize}

\section{The Scope of the Work}
\subsection{The Current Situation}
It is important to note that we will not be using the existing solution other
than as a feature guide. The current solution is hosted on the web and is
written in PHP. The current login system does not use a username and password.
Only captains can log in, and they are emailed an ASCII code which they use to
access the website to schedule games and submit scores. Commissioners can login
in the same way as captains and can modify schedules, scores and team
compositions as needed. Currently the standings functionality, which would
allow users to view the scores of played games, is not working.

\section*{Appendix --- Reflection}

The information in this section will be used to evaluate the team members on the
graduate attribute of Lifelong Learning.  Please answer the following questions:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item What knowledge and skills will the team collectively need to acquire to
  successfully complete this capstone project?  Examples of possible knowledge
  to acquire include domain specific knowledge from the domain of your
  application, or software engineering knowledge, mechatronics knowledge or
  computer science knowledge.  Skills may be related to technology, or writing,
  or presentation, or team management, etc.  You should look to identify at
  least one item for each team member.
  \item For each of the knowledge areas and skills identified in the previous
  question, what are at least two approaches to acquiring the knowledge or
  mastering the skill?  Of the identified approaches, which will each team
  member pursue, and why did they make this choice?
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Alex Verity -- Reflection}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item What went well while writing this deliverable?\\\\
  The parts that went well for me were the non-functional requirements, I felt
  the look and feel section gave me a much better idea of what the solution is
  going to look like. The TA meeting was also extremely helpful and gave me a
  much better perspective on the project and confidence in our solution.
  \item What pain points did you experience during this deliverable, and how
  did you resolve them?\\\\
  Some pain points experienced were trying to get full coverage when coming up
  with use cases and functional requirements, we have many more questions for
  the supervisor now and will almost certainly need to come back to this
  document and modify it with new information we recieve. I still don't know
  if the use cases provided are well put together or not and will be looking
  heavily at feedback in that area.
  \item How many of your requirements were inspired by speaking to your
  client(s) or their proxies (e.g. your peers, stakeholders, potential users)?
  \\\\
  Almost all requirements are inspired by speaking to our supervisor and
  primary stakeholder, as he defined the entire project during meetings with
  him. We were also heavily inspired by the TA meeting, where many of the
  look and feel requirements and user guide requirements came from, as well
  as advice on what to make into functional requirements.
  \item Which of the courses you have taken, or are currently taking, will help
  your team to be successful with your capstone project.\\\\
  The class 4HC3, whose subject is human computer interfaces and talks mainly
  about designing user interface. One of the main goals of the project is
  designing the UI to be more readable and better designed than the current
  solution, so any learning in that regard will be vital.

\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Jung Woo Lee -- Reflection}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item What went well while writing this deliverable?\\\\
  What pain points did you experience during this deliverable, and how did you resolve them? 
  Going through and working on this document, made me realize how much more we as a team probably need to know about user needs. Sometimes we were left with questions on if something was a requirement or not. All of this indicated to the fact that we need to have more time to speak to our supervisor.
  
  \item What pain points did you experience during this deliverable, and how
  did you resolve them?\\\\
  Almost all of the requirements came from the supervisor, who is both a potential user and stakeholder. With the initial information he provided us on the problem and desired product, we could develop most of these requirements. A few of the requirements were not explicitly told to us, but could be inferred and others have been created by us to conform with ethical practices for example.
  \item How many of your requirements were inspired by speaking to your
  client(s) or their proxies (e.g. your peers, stakeholders, potential users)?
  \\\\
  Almost all requirements are inspired by speaking to our supervisor and
  primary stakeholder, as he defined the entire project during meetings with
  him. We were also heavily inspired by the TA meeting, where many of the
  look and feel requirements and user guide requirements came from, as well
  as advice on what to make into functional requirements.
  \item Which of the courses you have taken, or are currently taking, will help
  your team to be successful with your capstone project.\\\\
  All project based courses are definitely useful to understand project dynamics. Dealing with a team, and performing to certain standards has been taught to us in all of these various courses. Providing deliverables and project scheduling has also been taught to us, such that administrative duties are easier for us to tackle. The databases course will likely help us as our project will most likely be using this in our solution. The user-interface course will help us in creating a human-centred design that is intuitive and clean. This is one of the pitfalls of the current solution, and thus one of the important non-functional requirements. The requirements course will also help us interpret requirements going forward and make use of our work here. And late it will undoubtedly help us revise this document.
