\section{Purpose of the Project}

\subsection{User Business}

The McMaster GSA softball league's current scheduling and management platform
is used from the 1st week of May until the last week of August. The website
creates a season schedule based on the 30-40 teams that are entered into the
league by their respective captains. If scheduling conflicts or weather concerns
occur, games are able to be rescheduled by the team captains based on a team's
availability. For the many users interacting with the platform, individuals need
an intuitive interface that is robust and will allow administrators to easily
maintain the system, especially when the website experiences problems. The current
platform lacks the capabilities to provide these functionalities to the players,
captains, and commissioners. With this project, our team is provided an
opportunity to apply our software engineering background to fulfill a
desired need for an upgrade to an outdated website.

\subsection{Goals of the Project}
Our goals with the project are to recreate everything the current website
solution does, with a better user interface and a more stable foundation, so
that future site admins and league commissioners don't have to deal with the
solution breaking or captains/players not understanding how to use the tool.
We also plan to add features such as player accounts to help players view
their schedules, and a standings viewer to see league scores.

\section{Stakeholders}
\subsection{Client}

The client of the project, Dr. Jake Nease, is an active participant in the
McMaster GSA softball league and understands the difficulties associated with
the current scheduling and management platform. The stability and maintainability
concerns with the website are driving factors that contribute to the need for
an improved interface.

\subsection{Customer}

The customers for this project include the players, captains, commissioners,
umpires, and other individuals that may interact with the website. These
individuals require an easy-to-use platform that allows them to seamlessly
enter the website and view the season schedule, whether or not they have an
account created. 

\subsection{Other Stakeholders}

Future website administrators and maintainers have an interest in the
maintainability, learnability of administrative functions, and the robustness
of the website.

  \reqdesc Non-commissioner accounts can only be a member of one team.
  \reqrat To ensure competition is fair and to avoid captains accidentally
  making extranious teams, users are limited to one team each.
  \reqorig Alex Verity
  \reqfit Once a team is created by a captain or a team is joined by a player,
  they shall not be allowed to use the functionality to create a team or join
  a team.

\section{Naming Conventions and Terminology}
\subsection{Glossary of All Terms, Including Acronyms, Used by Stakeholders
involved in the Project}
Sandlot: Management software for a softball baseball league, the software that
is the subject of this document.\\\\
Player: A person who plays on a baseball team in the league. They have an
account on Sandlot and are a member of a team.\\\\
Captain: A person who plays and leads a baseball team in the league. They are
in charge of defining the team's information on Sandlot.\\\\
Team: A name and a list of players representing a baseball team defined by a
captain. Teams are stored on a database on Sandlot.\\\\


\section{Relevant Facts And Assumptions}
\subsection{Relevant Facts}
\begin{itemize}
  \item The current solution is a website with url 
  \url{https://www.gsasoftball.ca/}
  \item There are currently 25-32 teams in the league playing an average of
  100 games a month.
  \item Many users are older and require an intuitive UI to enjoy using the
  site
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Business Rules}
Not applicable

\subsection{Assumptions}
\begin{itemize}
  \item All users will understand how to log in to a website using a username
  and password.
  \item Users will know how a softball league is structured and how it functions.
\end{itemize}

\section{The Scope of the Work}
\subsection{The Current Situation}
It is important to note that we will not be using the existing solution other
than as a feature guide. The current solution is hosted on the web and is
written in PHP. The current login system does not use a username and password.
Only captains can log in, and they are emailed an ASCII code which they use to
access the website to schedule games and submit scores. Commissioners can login
in the same way as captains and can modify schedules, scores and team
compositions as needed. Currently the standings functionality, which would
allow users to view the scores of played games, is not working.

      (in) & Record the team captain's entered availability schedule. This
      will be used to generate the league schedule.\\

      7. User submits alert & Alert Content (in) & Commissioners can submit custom
      alerts to send to any chosen users.\\
      8. System sends alert & Alert Content (out) & Send the alert to any user the

\section*{Appendix --- Reflection}

The information in this section will be used to evaluate the team members on the
graduate attribute of Lifelong Learning.  Please answer the following questions:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item What knowledge and skills will the team collectively need to acquire to
  successfully complete this capstone project?  Examples of possible knowledge
  to acquire include domain specific knowledge from the domain of your
  application, or software engineering knowledge, mechatronics knowledge or
  computer science knowledge.  Skills may be related to technology, or writing,
  or presentation, or team management, etc.  You should look to identify at
  least one item for each team member.
  \item For each of the knowledge areas and skills identified in the previous
  question, what are at least two approaches to acquiring the knowledge or
  mastering the skill?  Of the identified approaches, which will each team
  member pursue, and why did they make this choice?
\end{enumerate}
